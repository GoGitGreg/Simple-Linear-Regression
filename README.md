# Simple-Linear-Regression

Provides an example of how simple linear regression can be accomplished with a few lines of python code.

Data is coming from Alpha Vantage, which offers free API keys.  In order for the code to run you will need to switch out my config.api_key with your api key.

The code will make an api request for the ticker symbol of your choosing, create a dataframe, develop the regression model, and then output a regression and residual plot.


Ultimately allowing you to predict what the dependent variable might be based off your independent variable.
